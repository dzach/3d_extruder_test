3D printer extruder performance test

Most (new) 3D printer owners would like to know what the maximum print speed of their printer is. So what's easier, we set the feed rate high, choose a nice object or one made for calibration and print we go. If the object prints nicely and there are no missing steps at the extruder or any other motor, then declare the new record and live happily ever after. Or not?

Unfortunately not. There are a number of ways the speed of an extruder can be limited that make it necessary to define and follow a set of conditions before an  measurement of print speed and extruder performance can be made.

This is an effort to define a simple set of prerequisite conditions, test objects and test procedures necessary for an assessment of 3d printer extruder performance. Test results are accompanied with photographs of successfully printed test objects. An Excel spreadsheet is provided as a template to help organize and perform the test together with sample test results.
